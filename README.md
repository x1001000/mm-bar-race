# MacroMicro Bar Race Extension

A Chrome extension that adds animated bar race visualization to Highcharts on MacroMicro.me

## Features

- Converts MacroMicro line charts into animated bar race charts
- Horizontal bars with automatic sorting/racing effect
- Preserves original data and colors from the chart
- Large animated date display
- Easy toggle between original view and bar race view
- Smooth 200ms frame animations showing data changes over time

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select this project folder (`/Users/PHIL/Downloads/mm-bar-race/`)
5. The extension is now installed!

## Usage

1. Go to any MacroMicro chart page, for example:  
   https://www.macromicro.me/collections/4093/us-big-tech/109709/big-techs-m7-capex  
   https://www.macromicro.me/charts/109709/big-techs-m7-capex

2. You'll see a floating "ðŸ“Š Bar Race" button in the top right

3. Click the button to transform the chart into an animated bar race

4. Click "ðŸ“ˆ Original View" to switch back to the original chart

## How It Works

The extension uses a two-script architecture:

1. **content.js** - Runs in the extension context:
   - Injects the page script into the page context
   - Creates the toggle button UI
   - Handles messaging between contexts

2. **page-script.js** - Runs in the page context:
   - Has access to the page's Highcharts global object
   - Fetches chart data from MacroMicro API
   - Transforms time series data into bar race format
   - Destroys and recreates the chart as a bar race
   - Animates through the time series showing value changes
   - Restores the original chart when toggled off

## Data Flow

1. User clicks the bar race button
2. Content script sends message to page script
3. Page script extracts chart ID from URL
4. Fetches data from: `https://www.macromicro.me/charts/data/{chart_id}`
5. Transforms data and recreates chart as bar race
6. Animates through dates with 200ms intervals
